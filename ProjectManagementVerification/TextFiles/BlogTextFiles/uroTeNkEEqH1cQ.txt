<p>I have a problem with the chosen jquery plugin. When i try to search for a string which has space in between i have as a result "No results" even if it does exit. For example:<a href="http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/" rel="nofollow">http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/</a> in this plugin, i'm searching the string "and barbu" ==&gt; the result as you can see is "No results match "as barbu" ". But when i wrote "antigua and barbu" a had a result. So what should i do to fix this space problem?</p><p>Please give me an answer</p><p>anyone.....<span style="color: #ff0000;">????</span></p>
